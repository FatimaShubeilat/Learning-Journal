I have always have been a persuading to follow my passion in computer science since the day we have bought a PC to our house in 1996, and from that moment I could not stop myself from trying to explore everything interesting about it, as this grows by time, to see how it was an astonishing miracle, to translate all our senses into 0’s and 1’s.

# Learning Journal

Here I will be taking you to my own experience to describe how learning can be a great help to growth your mind, if you choose it to be a thing that can be developed.

## Getting Started

Allow me to choose my experience in learning how to publish pages at Github.


### Prerequisites 

Firstly you need to get familiar with [Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) that helps you to format your code in a simple way.

Then we need to check [how to create our own website](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) at GitHub


# So how you can benefit from a growth mindset
=========================================

As shown, I started with no idea what is exactly Github is, also this is the first time I knew what was Markdown! first I had some problems and struggles in understanding each of it, but by reading on and on also by trial and error also the help of others it was finally clear! I felt at first that I am a complete potato, but then things became better by time and trying.
So to be creative you need to embrace the growth mindset. So you can achieve high goals.

## 3 reminders to myself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset:
  1. Challenges
  2. Obstacles
  3. Effort

**After being introduced with the Gowth Mindset, we will go through a practical and a personal experince of ours on how we did a mind growth process by learning a complete new topic, you can check the next *Table Content:***
