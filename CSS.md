# CSS Introduction
Css are just like rules to control the HTML content or elements, so that you can control how you want it to be styled.

## How to choose the elements?

You need to select the element by a selector using this rule as shown in the figure:

## How we can implement CSS
1- [Inline CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_inline)
2- [Internal CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_internal)
3- [External CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_external)

## CSS Selectors

CSS selctors are based on HTML elements, so you will notice similarities while checking CSS codes.

I would recommend this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) to get to know more about Selectors.

## CSS Color
Now we will be introduced to css color selector, it helps to choose your text color using three ways:
1- [RGB Values](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html)
2- [HEX Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/)
3- [Color Names](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp)

Also you can change the background color of some sections and to be careful with a concept that is called contrast to make the colors comfortable to the eye. I would recommend this online [tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to help you to choose the right contrast percentage.
