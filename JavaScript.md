## How I can write a script?

We know that HTML is the basic structure for our webpage, and to add some spices on it we use css to make it more attractive and comfortable to be viewd, and with the help of Javascript we can make the Webpage more interactive so that things get more exciting!

In order to create a basic Javascript we can write it using a plain text just like HTML and CSS. And the best way to understand how things go, we can use the help of this [Book](http://javascriptbook.com/about/).

We went first to creating the Javascript file and how to add it using <script> at the bottom of the HTML page before the closing tag of the <body> tag, so that it will not affect the webpage when it is loaded.
