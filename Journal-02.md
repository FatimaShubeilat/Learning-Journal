# Reflection
----------------
### As a summary for what I have learned so far for the past 2 days.
>
By trying to practice the lab and the reading assignments, I felt that I need to pay more attention for what is required, and try to get out of my own box and perspective to check the other party requirment. Which in this way helps me to learn more effectively, than just applying what I already expect.
At first it was hard, but I think by time it will be more easier, because by being patient anyhing is achievable.
>
Also I liked the idea of going with the ways that are already suggested, and then go to the strech goals to find a space for the creativity part that needs to have its space.
Looking at the assignments that are required, they may sound something that is too much to do. But at the long run I believe we will get its fruit, because we will be practicing and more diving into the topics and ideas, which will eventually help to improve.
In Lab01, the demo was so helpful in demonstrating the guidelines before going to the Lab01, which allowed us to use the demo code copy to modify later as the Lab asks to. Then we practiced moreover the 'prompt' by writing 4 of them, and also to be familiar with the alert function as well and to use the input as an output again that shows on the screen.
then for trouble shooting we learned about a troubleshooting tool, called consol.log(), as it will not appear to the user, only exists for the developerâ€™s sake.
Also being familiar with styling using the internal way.And finally to use a new way to share our file at Github (Gist).
>
In Lab02, we were introduced to new functions that transform strings into upper or lower case(.toUpperCase() / .toLowerCase() )
Again we practiced the alert and prompt functions also to use the condition statements as (if and switch) 
After that we used 'use strict' at the top of javascript file to help us to troubleshoot step by step.
>
At read 02, we read an introduction about HTML and CSS also learned about some Javascript basics as Decisions and loops.
Then went through Read 03 to learn about lists and boxes, and learned furthermore about decisions and loops afterwards we applied it using Lab 03. Which helped in depth understanding of these terms and concepts.
