# Git Introduction 
Git is a [Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS)](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/). Where a group of developers can use it separately at their own PC's to assemble it at the end using the storage cloud, which is here called Github.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before Starting it is highly recommended to be familiar with Terminal (As for Mac) or what is called command line (for Windows & Linux).

### Installing

You can check [here](https://fatfooot.github.io/Learning-Journal/texteditors) to know exactly how to deal with the CLI and to learn more about it also how to download and install it.

### What is Git?
so Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file made of snapshots, when you save a changed version of your project (called commit) it will create a snapshot of the file and stores a reference of it.

By working localy you can check the history of edits without the need to be online or when using a vpn.

So since it is locally stored it will not be lost if the server is down.

To apply the files that are inside Git can be done by 
three steps:
1- Commited
2- Modified 
3- Staged
