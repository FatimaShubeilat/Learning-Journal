# Introducing How Computers Work

Now we can see the computers everywhere, in our pockets, or wearing them as watches, or many other applications, which give you a quick access to them which makes you use it at your everyday activities.

**To get to know computers**, we need to know how computers work! and how it is implement the information as electricity (signals: ON/OFF). And of course to get introduced to the main 4 parts of a computer.

# What Makes a Computer, a computer?
Computers are tools to help us to do things that are considered to be complex to be done in a short time.
By time the inventros came to know there are 4 basic instructions should be done at each computer that is designed which are:
1- Input 
2- Storage Input
3- Process
4- Output

And by these 4, that what makes a computer, a computer!

# Binary & Data

Computers work on 1's & 0's, inside a computer there are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer. 
The wires carry either ON or OFF signals, which indicates 1 or 0. And it is called **BIT**, which the smallest information that a computer can store. So by using more wires, you will be using many bits too. Which helps to present more complex information. So for 8 wires you will be able to present numbers between ( 0 and 255 ).

## Images in Binary

Images are consisting of pixels, each pixel has a color which is represented with numbers.

# CPU, Memory, Input & Output

The computer receives the input, then store it, the CPU processes it and then it will be outputed.

# Circuits and Logic

Complicated circuits take multiple signals & combine them to give different results.

# Hardware and Software

## Operating System
Is a madter program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer. It is installed in the memory and connected to input, output, and CPU. it is the one which of the programs should be processed so it switches quickly between prgrams.
